Consider the non-linear, inviscid Burgers equation for $u(x,t)$,
\begin{equation}
\pp{u}{t} + u \pp{u}{x} = 0
\;,
\end{equation}
with the initial conditions
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
u(x,0) &= 10 &\quad 0  \le\; &x \le 30 \;, \\
u(x,0) &= 0  &\quad 30 \le\; &x \le 40 \;.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Use the following finite-difference approximations to numerically integrate this equation using appropriate Dirichlet or Neumann BCs on an $x$-grid with $\Delta x = 0.2$:
\begin{enumerate}
\item MacCormack explicit method
\item Beam and Warming implicit method
\end{enumerate}

Note that the second method  may require the incorporation of a smoothing operator added directly to the finite difference formula. Using a fourth-order artificial viscosity, optimize the coefficient of this operator for minimum amplitude errors,
\begin{equation}
D_\epsilon = - \epsilon(\Delta x)^4 \pp{^4 V}{x^4}
\;,
\end{equation}
where the negative sign ensures that positive dissipation is produced. Using central differences, we obtain
\begin{equation}
\epsilon(\Delta x)^4 \pp{^4 V}{x^4} = V_{i-2} -4V_{i-1} +6V_i -4V{i+1} +V{i+2}
\;.
\end{equation}
The coefficient $\epsilon$ generally obeys $0 \le \epsilon \le 1/8$, with a preferred value of $\epsilon = 0.1$.

For both methods, plot the solutions at intervals of about two time units up to about $t=8$ time units. Obtain solutions for Courant numbers of $C = \{\tfrac{3}{4}, 1, \tfrac{5}{4}\}$. Comment on the stability of the scheme and dispersive/dissipative errors.
